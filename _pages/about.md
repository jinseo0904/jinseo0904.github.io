I am a first-year PhD student in the Personal Health Informatics program at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). I am a member of the [mHealth Research Group](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/), where I am advised by Professor [Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/). Before joining Northeastern, I completed my BA in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in May 2024.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at UPenn's [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Sunghye Cho](https://www.sunghyecho.com/). My research focused on analyzing the linguistic performance of Korean speakers with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, I contributed to large-scale audio annotation projects and published the [Korean Word Frequency Norms (KoFREN)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.866/), which aim to facilitate linguistic analysis for Korean-speaking populations.

I am interested in...
======
- Designing innovative sensing and intervention technologies using mobile computing devices (such as smartphones and smartwatches) to achieve the following objectives:
  - Assist individuals with underlying medical conditions in tracking and monitoring their symptoms
  - Collect and construct large, high-quality activity and health datasets for potential use in training AI/ML models for early detection and prognosis
  - Support individuals in building **and maintaining** healthy habits, such as regular exercise and a nutritious diet
  - Help individuals eliminate distractions and stay focused on important tasks to boost productivity and improve time management, with potential applications for assisting individuals with medical conditions

Coffeehead
======
I'm a dedicated coffee enthusiast, and my day isn't complete without a double-shot iced Americano—twice a day. Since moving to Boston, I’ve set up a mini espresso bar in my apartment, featuring a [Lelit Bianca V3](https://www.lelit.com/en-us/product/bianca-pesbn03) espresso machine and a [Niche Zero](https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/products/niche-zero?srsltid=AfmBOorlBbXx_EmO9VSEIYUns7QnuR1Iowju55nYFoMRW_fP6if24qdh) grinder. If you know me personally and want to try my espresso drinks—including my espresso martini—you’re always welcome to drop by!

Here are a few snapshots of my coffeehead journey:
